# Work in progress...
Also check out [openGPMP](https://github.com/akielaries/openGPMP).

Building an operating system on the Raspberry Pi 2 with eventual 
implementation on the aarch64 Raspberry Pi 3 & 4. 

# Introduction
- RPI-OS aarch32 & aarch64 
- Project repo piggybacking off of many online tutorials on how to create a simple OS for aarch32
  raspberry pi 2. I will be exploring creation for aarch64 rpi 3 & 4

## About
Add details on completion

## Usage
TODO

### Installation
- Steps on how to install this project, to use it.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:akielaries/RPI-OS_tut.git
$ cd /build &&
make
```
- Be very detailed here, For example, if you have tools which run on different operating systems, write installation steps for all of them.

```
$ add installations steps if you have to.
```

### Commands
- Commands to start the project.

## Development
- Langs close to the metal only

### Pre-Requisites
ARM gcc compiler toolchain:
```
$ sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-none-eabi
```
QEMU for ARM processors:
```
$ sudo apt-get install qemu-system-arm
